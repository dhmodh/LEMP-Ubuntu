## Introduction

In this guide, **LEMP** stands for **Linux**, **Nginx** (pronounced as
Engine-X), **MySQL** and **PHP** (PHP Hypertext Preprocessor). Also, as a
bonus.

I have gone through many websites in order to learn even just the basics of
setting up a LEMP server. Here I have created a through guide to help someone 
relatively new to setup a powerful LEMP machine easily and effortlessly. 
I hope this guide comes to someone's rescue.

The instructions on this guide has been tested to work on a fresh install of
Ubuntu 20.04. Also, the system was fully updated before we started with the 
LEMP setup procedure.

For any other platform, this guide should still serve as a useful resource. The
"mini goals" are well defined in various paragraphs. And one can easily look
elsewhere for specific instructions for that platform to achieve same "mini
goal", one at a time.

For a system already running other version of server stacks (example LAMP),
some additional steps (like removing those packages or disabling them) might
be required. That is beyond the scope of this guide.
